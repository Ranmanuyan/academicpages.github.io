Starting from a real industrial case, a set of engineering problems will be defined, addressing the range of typical problems a manufacturing company has to face in a multidisciplinary way by a group of students spending about 5 weeks in a company, with the aim at exploiting the tools and methods learned to analyze, formalize and provide a solution to it.

Possible framework engineering problems will be:

- The design and reconfiguration of a manufacturing system.
- Evaluate the impact of a new or modified product.
- The introduction of a new process technology.
 

The following activities will be carried out: 

- Industrial Internship: all the students will be given the opportunity to spend a period of internship in the company proposing the manufacturing problem under study. 

- Seminars/Lectures: seminars/lectures will be organized to deepen all the technological and management aspects connected to the problem under study.

- Lab experience: specific problems will be addressed by the students by directly using labs and facilities at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Department of Industrial Engineering as well as other facilities working in close relation with Politecnico di Milano.

- Real data modelling and analysis: data collected in real industrial contexts will be provided and used to design and/or validate the solutions provided.
